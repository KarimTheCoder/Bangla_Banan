# Bangla Spelling Practice App

**An interactive Android application to help users master Bangla spelling, built with Jetpack Compose and leveraging modern learning techniques.**

---

## üåü Overview

This app is a personal project aimed at making Bangla spelling practice more engaging and effective. It's designed to assist both young learners and anyone looking to improve or refresh their Bangla spelling skills. While currently in a **prototype stage**, it showcases a solid foundation for an interactive learning experience.

The core idea is to move beyond traditional rote learning by incorporating features that make the process dynamic and memorable.

## ‚ú® Features (Planned/Implemented)

* **Interactive Spelling Drills:** Engaging exercises to practice correct Bangla spelling. (Implemented)
* **Modern Learning Techniques:** Utilizes concepts like **Spaced Repetition** to optimize learning retention and recall. (Implemented)
* **Intuitive UI with Jetpack Compose:** A modern, declarative UI built entirely with Jetpack Compose for a smooth user experience. (Implemented)
* **MVVM Architecture:** Clean and maintainable codebase following the Model-View-ViewModel pattern. (Implemented)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technologies

This project is built following modern Android development best practices:

* **Kotlin:** The primary programming language.
* **Jetpack Compose:** For building the native Android UI.
* **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** A robust architectural pattern for separation of concerns and testability.
* **Android Framework:** Core Android APIs.
* **ML Kit Digital Ink:** For recognizing writing

## üí° Origin & Enhancements

This project was initially forked from the **ML Kit Digital Ink Recognition Quickstart** sample. While the original sample focused on handwriting recognition, this application significantly diverges by building an entirely new user interface and learning logic on top of the underlying Android framework. My aim was to transform it into a dedicated spelling practice tool, with an emphasis on interactive learning methods and a clean Compose-based UI.

The initial fork provided a great starting point for leveraging certain Android capabilities, but the current app represents a substantial rewrite and re-imagining for its specific educational purpose.

## ü§ù Contribution

This project is currently in a prototype phase, and I'm unable to dedicate much more time to active development due to other commitments. However, I truly believe in its potential!

If you're an Android developer looking for an **open-source project to contribute to**, want to explore **Jetpack Compose** and **MVVM** in a practical context, or have ideas to enhance Bangla language learning, feel free to **fork this repository**!

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
